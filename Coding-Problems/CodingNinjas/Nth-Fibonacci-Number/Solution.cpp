Problem Statement
The n-th term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated
using the formula: F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1

Provided 'n' you have to find out the n-th fibonacci number. Handle edge cases
liek when you have n = 1 or n = 2 by using coditionals like if else and return
whats expected

Example:
Input: 6
Output: 8

Explanation: The number is '6' aso we have to find the "6th" Fibonacci number.
So by using the given formula of the fibonacci series, we get the series :
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]

So the "6th" element is "8" hence we get the output.

Sample Input 1:
6


Sample Output 1:
8


Explanation of sample input 1 :
The number is ‘6’ so we have to find the “6th” Fibonacci number.
So by using the given formula of the Fibonacci series, we get the series:
[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
So the “6th” element is “8” hence we get the output.


Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(n).


Constraints:
1 <= 'n' <= 10000
Where ‘n’ represents the number for which we have to find its equivalent
Fibonacci number.

Time Limit: 1 second
