Problem Statement
You are given the starting 'I' and the ending 'r' positions of the array 'ARR'.
You must sort the elements between 'i' and 'r'.

Note:
Change in the input array itself. So no need to return or print anything.

Example:
Input:
'n' = 7
'arr' = {2, 13, 4, 1, 3, 6, 28}

Output:
'arr' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 28}

Explanation:
After appying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13,
28}

Sample Input 1:>
7
2 13 4 1 3 6 28
Sample Output 1:>
1 2 3 4 6 13 28
Explanation of Sample Output 1:>
After applying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is [1 2 3 4 6 13 28].
Sample Input 2:>
5
9 3 6 2 0
Sample Output 2:>
0 2 3 6 9
Explanation of Sample Output 2:>
After applying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is [0 2 3 6 9].
Constraints :>
1 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
